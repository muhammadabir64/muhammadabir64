## Whatsapp-Bulk
I developed a WhatsApp Bulk platform for an Egyptian team using PHP and MySQL. This platform includes features such as bulk messaging, secure hash code integration, advanced content filtering, user management, and database optimization. Additionally, I integrated a payment system that allows users to make payments using various TRC20 cryptocurrencies, including USDT TRC20. As the lead developer, I managed all aspects of the project, from design to testing, and collaborated closely with the client. The platform is now in active use and has enhanced the team's outreach with efficient and secure bulk messaging, receiving positive feedback for its usability and reliability.
